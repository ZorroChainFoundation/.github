# 🦊 ZorroChain Foundation  

ZorroChain is a civic protocol architecture designed for integrity in collapse:  
offline governance, post-quantum identity, and human continuity beyond networks.

This GitHub organization is home to ZorroChain’s sovereign modules, relay tools, and coordination logic.  
The stack is modular, mesh-operable, and built under an open civic license (MPL-2.0).

Also in extremely early test/scaffolding/proto in many/most.

## 🧱 Core Principles

- **Resilience > Uptime**  
  Governance must continue — even during blackout, censorship, or network loss.

- **Post-Quantum by Default**  
  Dilithium and SPHINCS+ are supported at genesis. Future-resilient signing is required for civic dignity.

- **No Tokens, No Venture Capital**  
  We are a public-interest foundation. There is no token, no equity, no speculative roadmap.

- **Civic Before Crypto**  
  All tools are built for verifiability, identity recovery, and mesh survivability — not yield farming.
